      "### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n",
      "Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive headaches that are worse in the morning. She reports intermittent seizure activity starting approximately 6 weeks ago, characterized by focal onset with occasional secondary generalization. Patient has also noticed mild left leg weakness over the past month, occasional episodes of confusion, memory lapses, and transient visual disturbances including brief episodes of blurred vision.\n",

      "MRI with and without contrast reveals a 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in the right frontal region. The lesion demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with a dural tail sign. There is moderate surrounding edema with minimal mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma. No evidence of brain invasion, atypical features, or high cellularity.\n",

      "### ASSESSMENT\n",
      "WHO Grade I meningioma (presumptive radiological diagnosis), parasagittal/falx location, 4.2 cm. The tumor's location near the motor strip likely explains the left leg weakness. Morning headaches suggest increased intracranial pressure. Seizures are likely related to cortical irritation from the tumor.\n",

      "This 56-year-old female data scientist with a history of radiation exposure for pituitary adenoma presented in 2018 with a 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx WHO Grade I meningioma. Initial conservative management with anti-seizure medications was pursued. Due to slow growth and persistent symptoms, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in April 2021, resulting in tumor shrinkage to 3.7 cm and complete resolution of symptoms. Throughout treatment, special attention was paid to occupational considerations, with workplace accommodations enabling continued employment. The patient's KPS score improved from a low of 70 during periods of symptom exacerbation to 100 currently. She remains on anti-seizure medication with plans for potential reduction. This case demonstrates the effectiveness of a measured, conservative approach to meningioma management, particularly in patients with prior radiation exposure.\n"

Reports intermittent right-sided weakness and paresthesia in the lower extremity. Experienced one episode of focal seizure affecting the right leg last month. Describes mild cognitive changes including difficulty with concentration while coding. Also notes occasional visual disturbances described as brief blurring in peripheral vision.\\n\\n### OBJECTIVE:\\n**Vital Signs:** BP 138/85, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 98.6\\u00b0F, O2 Sat 99%\\n\\n**Neurological Examination:**\\n- Mild weakness in right lower extremity (4+/5 strength)\\n- Decreased sensation to light touch in right lower extremity\\n- Mild papilledema on fundoscopic examination\\n- Remainder of cranial nerve examination intact\\n- Reflexes 2+ and symmetric\\n\\n**Imaging:**\\n- MRI Brain with and without contrast: 4.2 cm left parasagittal/falx meningioma with significant surrounding edema. Evidence of dural tail sign. Mass effect on the superior sagittal sinus with possible early invasion.\\n\\n**Laboratory:**\\n- CBC, CMP within normal limits\\n- Coagulation profile normal\\n\\n### ASSESSMENT:\\nLeft parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade II (atypical features on imaging), measuring 4.2 cm with mass effect and significant peritumoral edema. Given the patient's history of childhood radiation exposure, location, and size of tumor, this represents a high-risk meningioma with potential for progression.\\n\\n### PLAN:\\n1. Recommend early surgical intervention with goal of gross total resection (Simpson Grade I-II)\\n2. Pre-operative embolization to be considered given the size and vascular nature of parasagittal meningiomas\\n3. Start Dexamethasone 4mg PO QID with PPI for peritumoral edema\\n4. Start Levetiracetam 500mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis\\n5. Obtain functional MRI and DTI for surgical planning\\n6. Schedule surgery within 2 weeks\\n7. Occupational considerations: Patient should take medical leave from data science position immediately due to cognitive symptoms and seizure risk\\n8. KPS score: 80 (able to carry on normal activity with effort, some symptoms of disease)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## OPERATIVE NOTE - June 26, 2018\\n\\n### PROCEDURE:\\nLeft parasagittal craniotomy for resection of meningioma\\n\\n### FINDINGS:\\n- 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with firm consistency\\n- Tumor adherent to superior sagittal sinus with early invasion\\n- Simpson Grade II resection achieved (complete tumor removal with coagulation of dural attachment)\\n\\n### PATHOLOGY:\\nWHO Grade II Atypical Meningioma\\n- Increased mitotic activity (5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields)\\n- Increased cellularity\\n- Small foci of necrosis\\n- MIB-1 proliferation index: 8%\\n\\n### PLAN:\\n1. Postoperative MRI within 48 hours\\n2. Continue Dexamethasone with taper\\n3. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID\\n4. Recommend adjuvant radiation therapy given WHO Grade II pathology\\n5. Follow-up in 2 weeks for staple removal and discussion of adjuvant therapy\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT - July 10, 2018\\n\\n### SUBJECTIVE:\\nPatient reports improvement in headaches and right leg weakness. Denies new seizures. Reports mild incisional pain but otherwise doing well. Continues to have some difficulty with concentration.\\n\\n### OBJECTIVE:\\n**Vital Signs:** BP 132/80, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 98.2\\u00b0F\\n\\n**Examination:**\\n- Surgical site healing well, no signs of infection\\n- Improved strength in right lower extremity (5-/5)\\n- Improved sensation in right lower extremity\\n- No papilledema\\n\\n**Imaging:**\\n- Postoperative MRI: Near total resection of meningioma. Small residual enhancement along superior sagittal sinus. Decreased edema.\\n\\n### ASSESSMENT:\\nStatus post Simpson Grade II resection of WHO Grade II parasagittal/falx meningioma with good postoperative recovery.\\n\\n### PLAN:\\n1. Referral to radiation oncology for consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy\\n2. Taper Dexamethasone over next 7 days\\n3. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID\\n4. Recommend 4 more weeks of medical leave from work\\n5. Follow-up MRI in 3 months\\n6. KPS score: 70 (cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or do active work)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT - October 15, 2018\\n\\n### SUBJECTIVE:\\nPatient has completed course of adjuvant radiotherapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions). Reports improvement in concentration and cognitive function. Occasional headaches but less severe than preoperatively. No seizures. Has returned to work part-time as a data scientist.\\n\\n### OBJECTIVE:\\n**Vital Signs:** BP 128/76, HR 68, RR 14, Temp 98.4\\u00b0F\\n\\n**Examination:**\\n- Surgical site well-healed\\n- Normal strength in right lower extremity (5/5)\\n- Normal sensation\\n- No papilledema\\n\\n**Imaging:**\\n- 3-month post-op MRI: No evidence of tumor recurrence. Small area of enhancement at surgical site, likely post-surgical change. Minimal residual edema.\\n\\n### ASSESSMENT:\\nStatus post Simpson Grade II resection of WHO Grade II parasagittal/falx meningioma with completion of adjuvant radiotherapy. No evidence of recurrence.\\n\\n### PLAN:\\n1. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID for 3 more months, then consider tapering\\n2. May return to full-time work with recommendation to take frequent breaks\\n3. Follow-up MRI in 6 months\\n4.
